# Franz Plugins!

To use one of these plugins, you need to directory in your Franz Plugins Directory. Typically `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/Plugins` but may vary. You can also open Franz, open the setting scroll to the bottom and choose to open Plugin Directory.

My Desired way to add plugins to to checkout this repo, and link the plugins into the directory.

```bash
ln -s ~/repos/franz-plugins/office365-outlook ~/Library/Application\ Support/Franz/Plugins
```
